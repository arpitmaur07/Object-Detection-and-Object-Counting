<p align="center">Welcome to my object detection and object counting project! This project is designed to detect objects in images and videos and provide the total count of objects detected.</p>

<h3 align="center">Project Overview 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♂️ </h3>
<p>This project utilizes computer vision techniques and deep learning models to detect objects in images and videos. The object detection is performed using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm, and the object counting is done using OpenCV..</p>

<h2 align="center">Getting Started 👨‍🔧</h2>
<p>To get started with this project, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You will also need to install the following Python modules:-</p>
-Numpy <br>
-OpenCv <br> 
<p> You can install these modules using pip by running the following command:-</p>
<code> pip install opencv-python numpy </code> <br>
<p>Once you have installed these modules, you can clone the repository and run the main.py file to start the assistant.</p>

<h3 align="center">Usage 🧗‍♂️</h3>
<p>To use the object detection and counting tool, simply run the object_detection.py file. The tool will ask you to specify the path to the image or video file you want to analyze. The tool will then detect objects in the image or video and provide the total count of objects detected.</p>

<h3> Contributing😊 </h3>
<p>If you would like to contribute to this project, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. Please make sure that your code follows the PEP 8 style guide and includes tests where appropriate.</p>
